Arrive any time during the first hour to begin the evening with a silent auction accompanied by the most delicious appetizers in the realm washed down with mead and wine; her Majesty then invites you and a magical, mysterious guest or two, approximately an hour later, to a concert at her court to end the Yuletide season with a celebration of - The Boar&#39;s Head the world&#39;s oldest continuously celebrated Yuletide feast for over 650 years, with the music of Medieval through Contemporary England and lots of chances for you to sing along! Legend has it that a scholar was studying a book of Aristotle while walking through the forest on his way to Midnight Mass. Suddenly, he was confronted by an angry wild boar. Having no other weapon, the resourceful Oxonian rammed his metal-bound philosophy book down the throat of the charging animal, whereupon the brute choked to death. That night the boar&#39;s head, finely dressed and garnished, was borne in procession to the dining room, accompanied by carolers singing &quot;in honor of the King of bliss.&quot; After the concert you&#39;ll enjoy a feast featuring wassail, king&#39;s cake and traditional meat and vegetable pies.<br> <br> \n",
